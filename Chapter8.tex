\chapter{Evaluation}
\section{Introduction}
This chapter will present the evaluation criteria for our system. After presenting the criteria we will evaluate 2 systems presented in Chapter 6 and 7.
\section{Evaluation Criteria}
Following are the evaluations criteria and project goals that we have setup for our system:
\subsection{Unlinkability}
We want 2 to unlink the real identity of the user from the transactions. A user should not have to give his real identity to the bank in order to get the services. 
\subsection{Escrow}
It should be possible for authorities to get the real identity of the user in case of legal requirements or discrepancies. But still bank should not be able to get the real identities of the user.
\subsection{Minimal Technical Requirements}
It should be easy to be a customer at the bank. User should not have to change a lot of systems on their side to be a customer at the bank. Also it should be easier for existing customers to continue using the services of the bank.
\subsection{User awareness}
User should be aware about the data they are sharing with the bank. Bank should have user consent before storing any data from the user.
\subsection{Protection of sensitive data}
All the sensitive data about the user should be kept protected.
\section{Summary}
In this chapter we evaluated 2 different pseudonym systems as discusses in chapter 6 and 7. Also after that we discussed in detail the implementation of the IDEMIX system in the real world in our system.
