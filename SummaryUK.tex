\chapter{Summary}

In this thesis we performed an initial analysis of a single business process from administrative data management, with respect to identifying the need to bind authenticated identities to actions at the different steps of the process. Based on this analysis we presented a proposed model for the business process. We evaluated our model on different evaluation criteria set during the initial phase. Based on discussion with the stakeholders we arrived at conclusion that even though our proposed system solves a lot of privacy related problems for the stakeholders, but in case of business processes its not easy to change the legacy systems easily.
