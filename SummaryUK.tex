\chapter{Summary}

In this thesis we performed an initial analysis of a single business process from administrative data management, with respect to identifying the need to bind authenticated identities to actions at the different steps of the process. Based on this analysis we proposed a new model for the business process. We evaluated our model with different evaluation criteria, set during the initial phase. Based on discussion with the stakeholders, we arrived at the conclusion that even though our proposed system solves a lot of privacy related problems for the stakeholders, in case of business processes, it is not easy to change the legacy systems. We also found out an interesting set of problems that can arise with such systems.
